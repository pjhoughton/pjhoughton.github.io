      <h2>❓ What is Home Assistant?</h2>
      <p>
        Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform designed to run locally and integrate 
        with a wide variety of smart devices and services. It provides a central dashboard for monitoring 
        and controlling everything from lights and sensors to media players and cloud services.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of its key strengths is flexibility: Home Assistant supports thousands of integrations, 
        allowing you to unify devices from different vendors into a single, cohesive smart home system.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entities:</strong> The basic building blocks representing devices, sensors, or services.</li>
        <li><strong>Automations:</strong> Rules that trigger actions based on conditions (e.g., turn on lights at sunset).</li>
        <li><strong>Scripts:</strong> Sequences of actions that can be reused or triggered manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations:</strong> Connectors that allow Home Assistant to talk to external devices and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboards:</strong> Customizable user interfaces for monitoring and controlling your smart home.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ons:</strong> Extra services (like MQTT brokers or Node-RED) that extend Home Assistant’s functionality.</li>
      </ul>
