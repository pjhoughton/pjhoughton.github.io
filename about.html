    <h1>👤 About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Paul. I’ve worked in the IT industry for over 30 years and am currently a Systems Engineer 
      in a predominantly Windows and VMware environment. While I have extensive experience in enterprise systems, powershell 
      I started building my homelab to strengthen my skills in Linux, containers, and open‑source technologies. 
      This journey allows me to explore Docker, hypervisors, HTML, and home automation — blending decades of 
      professional expertise with modern, open‑source tools.

    <h2>📖 Biography</h2>
    <p>
      My career has spanned infrastructure, virtualization, and systems engineering. With a strong background 
      in Windows and VMware, I wanted to challenge myself by diving into areas I wasn’t as confident in — 
      particularly Linux and containerization. My homelab is the perfect environment to experiment, learn, 
      and document my progress while sharing knowledge with others.
