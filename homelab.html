      <p>
        My homelab is designed to be modular and resilient. It typically includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virtualization with Xen Orchestra/XCP-NG</li>
        <li>Containerized services managed with Docker and Docker Compose</li>
        <li>Automation and configuration management with Ansible</li>
        <li>Smart home integrations powered by Home Assistant</li>
        <li>Monitoring and logging tools for system health</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🛠️ Use Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing and deploying automation workflows</li>
        <li>Running self‑hosted services (media, backup, monitoring)</li>
        <li>Experimenting with new technologies before production use</li>
        <li>Integrating smart devices into a unified automation system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>❓ What is a Homelab?</h2>
      <p>
        A homelab is a personal environment where IT professionals and enthusiasts can experiment with 
        technologies outside of production systems. It provides a safe space to learn, test, and refine 
        skills in virtualization, automation, networking, and application deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Homelabs often mimic enterprise setups on a smaller scale, allowing for hands‑on practice with 
        tools like hypervisors, container platforms, and automation frameworks. They are also ideal for 
        running self‑hosted services and exploring smart home integrations.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Running multiple virtual machines using platforms like XCP‑NG or VMware.</li>
        <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Lightweight, portable services managed with Docker and Docker Compose.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Tools like Ansible streamline configuration and deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Managed with Unifi or similar solutions to connect devices securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Tools for tracking performance, uptime, and system health.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Home:</strong> Integrations with Home Assistant to unify devices and workflows.</li>
      </ul>
